Welcome to **tecto**. This tool helps you protect your digital tokens by using strong encryption. It works quietly in the background to keep your information safe. You don’t need any special skills to get started. This guide will show you how to download and use tecto step-by-step.

## 📖 What is tecto?

Tecto stands for *Transport Encrypted Compact Token Object*. It uses a type of encryption called XChaCha20-Poly1305. This makes any data in your tokens unreadable to others. Tokens are like digital keys or passes that systems use to verify who you are or what you can do online. Securing these tokens is very important to keep your information safe.

Tecto makes tokens:

- Hard to read without permission.
- Safe to transfer over the internet.
- Compact and efficient for fast use.

You don’t need to code or have deep knowledge about encryption. Just follow the steps to get tecto running.

### Step 2: Choose Your Version

Look for the latest stable release, usually marked by the highest version number without "beta" or "rc". There may be different files for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- For Windows, look for files ending in `.exe` or `.msi`.
- For macOS, files may end in `.dmg` or `.pkg`.
- For Linux, files might be `.tar.gz` or `.AppImage`.

Download the file that matches your operating system.

### Step 3: Run the Installer

Open the downloaded file to start the installation.

- On Windows, double-click the `.exe` or `.msi` file.
- On macOS, open the `.dmg` and drag the app to your Applications folder.
- On Linux, extract the `.tar.gz` if needed or run the `.AppImage` after making it executable.

## 🔍 How to Use tecto

The tecto app is designed with simplicity. Here’s a basic overview:

1. **Import Token:** Load the token you want to protect.
2. **Encrypt Token:** Choose encryption options (default settings work well for most).
3. **Export Token:** Save the encrypted token for use in your application or system.

You can also verify tokens, manage keys, and view logs in the app.

## 🔐 Why Encryption Matters

Tokens often carry sensitive data or verify your identity online. Without protection, anyone intercepting these tokens could misuse them. Encryption scrambles the contents, making it unreadable to outsiders.

Tecto uses trusted methods to protect tokens, so you can trust your data is safe during transport or storage.

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Experience

- Keep tecto updated with the latest releases found at the download page.
- Store your keys securely; losing them can mean losing access to your tokens.
- Use strong passwords or keyfiles to add extra protection.
- If sharing tokens, make sure the other party also uses secure tools.
- Consult your system or security administrator if unsure about deployment.
